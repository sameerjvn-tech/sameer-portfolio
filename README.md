## [Project 1: Image Classifier trained using transfer learning: Mask detector](https://github.com/sameerjvn-dl/maskON)
A simple two output Classifier that detects whether a face has a mask on or off. This project demonstrates how a small dataset (~350) images can be used to achieve near-100% accuracy with the use of pre-trained existing models.

- Scraped 191 images of people with a mask and 114 images of people without masks from duckduckgo.com
- Augmented the images using fastai's transform options for the DataBlock class
- Fine tuned on a pretrained RESNET-18 model for 100% accuracy on validation set.

 Deployed at - [MaskON Classifier](https://mask-on-clf.herokuapp.com/)
